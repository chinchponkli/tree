from tree import Tree

'''
1) Create an empty stack s.
2) Initialize current node as root
3) Push the current node to s and set current = current->left until current is None.
4) If current is None and stack is not empty then
     a) Pop the top item from stack.
     b) Print the popped item, set current = popped_item->right
     c) Go to step 3.
5) If current is NULL and stack is empty then we are done.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n) - size of stack.
